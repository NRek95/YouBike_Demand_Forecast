## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/NRek95/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/NRek95/your-repo-name.git)
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2. Add the Data

This project requires a large dataset that is not tracked by Git.

1.  Create a folder named `data` inside the main project directory.
2.  Place your large dataset (e.g., `dataset.parquet`) inside this `data` folder.

The code is pre-configured to find the data in this location automatically.

### 3. Run the Analysis

Open the `notebooks/your_notebook.ipynb` file in Google Colab or Jupyter and run the cells.
